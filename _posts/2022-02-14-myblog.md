			Will Johnson: [0:00] To install a new Jekyll plugin to your project, go to your Gemfile, and under the section group Jekyll_plugins do put in gem and then the name of your plugin. For me, it'll be jekyll-twitter-plugin.

[0:16] Then, copy the name of the plugin without the quotations and make sure you save your Gemfile, then go to config.yaml. Under the plugin section, type in - and then the name of the plugin, which for me is jekyll-twitter-plugin. Make sure you save that file as well.

[0:39] Go to the terminal, run bundle install. That will install the gem to your project, so now you can use the Jekyll Twitter Plugin.

[0:49] Go to your blog post. To use the Jekyll Twitter Plugin, you would use liquid tags, which is curly braces and percentage signs. Then I will type in twitter, and then I would copy the URL to the tweet that I want to show, and then paste it here. Make sure I save the blog post.
